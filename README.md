# Spotify-Data-Pipeline
A simple pipeline to download Spotify Data about what songs I have listened in past 24 hours and stores in a SQLlite Database.

This repo consists of a simple python code that uses Spotify API (which can be generated using https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/) to download my songs that have been played in the past 24 hours and stored in a SQLlite Database.
